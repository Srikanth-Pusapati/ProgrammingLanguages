Due Thursday March 9, at noon.

Adapt the combinator parser described at

http://mattwetmore.me/posts/parsing-combinators-with-parser-combinators.html

to work with the data types used for our course at

http://www.cse.unt.edu/~tarau/teaching/GPL/FP/

in modules LambdaTests (and its included modules).

Write a simple REPL (read-eval-print-loop) allowing one to enter a human readable lambda expression and print out the result of its evaluation. You might use our the lambda term printer of our course to print out the result.

The files Parser.hs and Untyped.hs contain the code described at
