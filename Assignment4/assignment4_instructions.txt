Due Thursday April 6, at noon.

Write an operator or DCG-based parser to read in the predicates

male/1, female/1, parent_of/2.

Write a grammar that parses queries about the family database, using the query word "Who" and answers those queries as proper English sentences. 

If you want to parse sentences more easily you might want to use something like:

?- split_string("Joe gives a book to Mary ."," ","",R),maplist(atom_string,Xs,R).
R = ["Joe", "gives", "a", "book", "to", "Mary", "."],
Xs = ['Joe', gives, a, book, to, 'Mary', '.'].

An example of query is:

"Who is the cousin of Mary ?"
