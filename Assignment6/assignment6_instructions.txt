Deadline Tuesday May 2, at noon. Note that as usual, this is a team assignment.

Implement in Scala or Swift the PageRank algorithm as described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank, subject to the following requirements:

1) You will need to test your program for correctness with the graph shown in the Wikipedia picture.

2) You will need to test your program for scalability by generating progressively larger random graphs with an algorithm of your choice - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph .
